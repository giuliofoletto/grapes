## Authorship and distribution

The bulk of `grapes` development was done by Giulio Foletto in his spare time.
See `LICENSE.txt` and `NOTICE.txt` for details on how `grapes` is distributed.

## Acknowledgements

`grapes` is inspired by [`pythonflow`](https://github.com/spotify/pythonflow) but with substantial modifications.

It relies internally on [`networkx`](https://networkx.org/) for graph management and on [`pygraphviz`](https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz) for graph visualization.

## Use of AI tools

Most of the development of `grapes` was done before AI coding tools were available.
However, recent edits (September 2025) were assisted by GitHub Copilot, especially for writing docstrings.
